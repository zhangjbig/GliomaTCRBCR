# GliomaTCRBCR
        This is to replicate the analysis of TCR and BCR derived from TRUST4 for gliomas in Chinese population. All scripts are coded in R language. To run scripts, the path needs to be modified accordingly.

        evaluating_indicator: calculating diversity,eveness and richness
        
        voronoiTreemap: generating voronoiTreemap

        FreqGenes: calculating the usage frequency of the genes and the distribution of the genes

        LengthCDR3: calculating the distributions of the CDR3 length.

        weblogoAnalysis: perform conservative analysis of amino acids
